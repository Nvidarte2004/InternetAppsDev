# ðŸŽ‚ Birthday Date Meaning Generator

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

The **Birthday Date Meaning Generator** is a PHP web-based application that takes a userâ€™s birth **month**, **day**, and **year** (between 2000â€“2023) and returns fun and meaningful interpretations based on numerology, mythology, and astrology. It is designed as an interactive app to engage users with repeated input using a loop structure.

The purpose of this project is to practice working with:
- `switch` statements
- `while` loops
- user input and basic form handling in PHP
