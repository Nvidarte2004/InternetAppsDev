# PHP BMI Calculator

##  Overview

The **PHP BMI Calculator** is a simple web-based tool that allows users to input their personal information—name, age, gender, height (in feet and inches), and weight in pounds—to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). The app then interprets the BMI using standard health categories such as Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.

This calculator is intended for general educational purposes and to demonstrate PHP form handling, basic math operations, and conditional statements.
